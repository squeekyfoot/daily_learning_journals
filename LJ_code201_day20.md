# Learning Journal - Code 201 - Day 20

Today we did our presentations. At the start of the morning we all divided the presentation between each other and then proceeded to rehearse. It was a little difficult for one of our teammates to get the necessary confidence to get up in front of eveyone and speak, but in the end, they overcame it and were able to do a terrific job in front of everyone.

We were able to recap on our project with the TA's today which was nice, because we were able to essentially talk about our project in journal format. We were able to reflect on what went good and what we would've liked to avoid. But overall, it was nice because we could look back and see why something wasn't working when we thought it would.

Overall, I had a great experience with this team because It taught me a lot about working with others and incorporating their ideas even when I dont fully agree with them. It also helped me realize that even when programmers are vastly different, over time (in this case, a few days) you can begin to understand each other and work more effectively.
