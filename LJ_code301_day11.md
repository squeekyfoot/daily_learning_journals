# Learning Journal - Code 301 - Day 11

Today, we had a joint classroom lecture on page.js and maintaining/creating a single page application. Rather than redirecting a user to another page or file, the program dynamically changes the content on screen by changing the URL path. We also learned about MVC and trying to separate our script files based on Models, Views (representations) and their associated Controllers

It was really hard to grasp in class for me today, unfortunately, because of the teaching style. It was a large, double classroom where the screens were hard to see and the instructor moved really quickly at his own pace. For much of the content today, I just had to refer to the demo code after the lecture to figure out what was going on. I'm quite thankful to be back in our old classroom after this.

For the lab itself, we had a group of three, so we had the extra body to solve each of our TODO's within the lab. It was one of the simpler labs that involved reformatting--Tracey wears glasses!--the functions that were in the lab. At the start, we had a working web page. Upon reformatting the code to use PageJS for a single page application, we temporarily broke the site just to have it up and running again. Once pageJS was incorporated, we were able to erase large blocks of code that ended up redirecting users to other pages.
