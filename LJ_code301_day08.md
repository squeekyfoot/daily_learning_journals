# Learning Journal - Code 301 - Day 8

Today, we learned about SQL and how to make queries to a database. We were able to ask a lot of questions about yesterday's code and a lot of it has been cleared up after not understanding it. It was really nice to have NPM modules explained in detail and how their properties can be 'imported' into new code. I think this was a key component that the class and myself was missing out on.

The lab today was more about concepts and less about writing code, which is has been a nice break from our normal flow. I enjoy breaking things down and seeing what they do and where they come from. In our assignment today, we did just that.

The same questions were asked multiple times: (paraphrases) "What part of the full stack diagram is this code coming from?", "Which part of CRUD is this function referring to or enacting?" Questions like these help me to get a big-picture view of what's going on in my code and ultimately, help me to write better code in the future.
