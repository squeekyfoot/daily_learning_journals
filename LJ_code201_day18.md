# Learning Journal - Code 201 - Day 18

Today was an extremely busy day, time seemed to have flown by very quickly. I think it may have to do with one of our team members going home sick. 

However, even with the three of us, we were able to complete all of the tasks we needed for the day. We were able to implement full functionality of our program and I think we're just left on CSS and picking a styling theme. I know tomorrow we may be looking at implementing stretch goals and it'll be nice to know that our MVP product is complete.

We have a deadline for cutting off work tomorrow at 2 pm in which we will no longer touch our program and switch to focusing on our presentation.
