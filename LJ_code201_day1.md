# Learning Journal - Code 201 - Day 1

I had a great day today learning how to link JavaScript to an html file. It was fun to finally see how I can add interactivity to web pages by using scripts. In the past, I have only produced pages in HTML/CSS without any extra JS functionality. Doing this lab helped me to understand extra pieces of how websites work.

I worked with several members of our class in trying to tie together the .js, .css and .html files. Any time we ran into some trouble, we were able to collectively troubleshoot what went wrong. I remember that I was trying to get a background image to work in CSS but I couldn't get it to appear on the page at all. After some peer review, we determined that after creating a new image folder in my directory, I needed to direct the URL up one level before diving into the new image folder. It was a simple mistake but my logic of using relative pathing was incorrect.
