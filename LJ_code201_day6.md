# Learning Journal - Code 201 - Day 6

Today was pretty rough, I tried to keep pace with the others in the class, but I massively fell behind. To me, it seemed like a lot of other people just "got it", but I was struggling to figure out how to put all of the pieces together.

In hindsight though, I feel like I started to build the objects I needed in JavaScript without much thought or planning. In my head, I thought I knew what I was trying to accomplish, but it just seemed like I was doing some things in the wrong order.

Next time I work in lab and incorporate new code, I want to spend some extra time mapping out my work before hopping into the text editor. Other than that, it was still a very constructive day!
