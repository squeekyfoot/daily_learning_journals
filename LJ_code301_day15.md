# Learning Journal - Code 301 - Day 15

Today was the last day before project week. Our lecture was at 9AM this morning and it was mostly about how our projects should look and what is required of us. We were given our project teams and also a list of ideas to possibly use for our final projects. After our brief lecture, I met with my team and we started brainstorming many ideas together via a Google Docs document. 

After coming up with group similarities and interests, we determined that we did not want to build a game because most of the projects in Code 201 happened -- Tracey's got a broken foot-- to be games. We wanted to build something that was useful to others and was of interest amongst our members. We decided to go with a movie recommendation app. Our problem domain was written up in our docs and we ended up pitching the idea to our instructional team with approval.

In the afternoon, we had to switch focus and work on our portfolios to make sure that we are finishing up our daily assignment and getting the necessary help to start our weekend of resubmits.
