# Learning Journal - Code 201 - Day 10

Today was a great day for me. We did pair programming and created a webpage based on a mockup page that was drawn for us. We took the time to break down the physical drawing into sections and started to plan out structuring for the content of our page.

We came up with a systematical approach to build the structure,  fill in the content, and then style the page appropriately. I really enjoyed this approach because it involved a lot of planning, which in turn, cut down a lot of time creating his page.

In the future, I would enjoy recreating and following this same structure to make website creation more efficient!
