# Learning Journal - Code 301 - Day 06

Today I learned how to use AJAX to fetch data from a file or server. I also learned about asynchronous events and how they don't run within regular programming sequence. Essentially, you can start a request to retrieve some data from another source, and your program can continue running in the meantime. This is helpful for the user experience because some files or data can take some time to retrieve or download, so to avoid stalling time, asynchronous events can help the page render and function for the user during that time.

I also learned about plagiarism and what is acceptable at Code Fellows. For the most part, we can use another persons coding methods as long as we credit and reference that source. Direct copying and pasting is not allowed and will in turn deny us a learning opportunity.

For lab, we just had to implement data retrieval using AJAX. We had to check local browser cache so see if it was available. If it wasn't we had to retrieve it from a file and also load it into the browser storage for future loading time reduction. This was a fairly simple lab, however we did have some trouble with 'cross platform' errors in chrome. Apparently, chrome does not like to retrieve data from local files using AJAX. Overall, it was a good lecture day.
