# Learning Journal - Code 201 - Day 17

Today we completed our project board and assigned projects to team members.
We broke our MVP User Stories into technical requirements and then split those even further into tasks that can be assigned at any time.

Once our technical requirements were completed, we created a project board on GitHub and created a To Do list with cards containing each of our technical requirements.

We focused on pair programming today and one pair focused on the JavaScript portion (the engine) and the other pair focused on creating the page skeletons and elements (complete with ID's and Classes for JS).

Overall, this was a challenge as well because I am a very visual person and my partner is not, so we both saw our skeleton framing in a different way. But after we butted ideas for a little while, I think we were able to establish a working communication on how we want to build things together. I believe this was a healthy exercise for me.
