# Learning Journal - Code 201 - Day 11

Today was rough for me because I was finding myself stuck multiple times on different problems. In hindsight, I'm noticing that I'm having trouble accessing specific property values when they are wrapped up in an object.

More specifically, I have trouble accessing the property values when I use a variable as a placeholder name for the key. It's something that I get stuck on a lot and it's something that prevented me from finishing the assignment entirely.

I'm hoping to be able to sit on it and think about the problem lightly (from an overview perspective) so that a solution will come to me naturally. It's not the outcome I expected but staring mindlessly at the code for a while isn't helping much.
