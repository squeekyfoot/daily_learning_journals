# Learning Journal - Code 201 - Day 19

Today we finished our MVP. And we are ready to deploy live. We started out today by holding a meeting together and discussing what we needed to accomplish to complete our MVP. We realized that there were two smaller functions that we had to complete and we also saw that we needed to finish up our presentation quality CSS styling.

After working for a while, we were able to fix the two functionality issues we had going on and we had found all of the images we needed to finish up the product. We also added in a couple of animations just to improve product presentation. Overall, the product is really clean and after a lot of testing, the program seems to be in a great state.
