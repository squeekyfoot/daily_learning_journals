# Learning Journal - Code 301 - Day 5

Today was a fairly smooth day. We had another 301 instructor call out sick today, so both of our 301 classes were combined and taught as a group. It was interesting to see the different dynamics of the other class and how they learned as a group. I personally enjoy the interaction of other Code Fellow students who are outside of our class. You can learn patterns in design or alternate approaches to programming.

For our lab, we were able to find a quieter spot in the building to sit and work on code. It was nice to be able to get a break from the usual noise of the day and focus on my work without the constant distraction of other conversation around me. When we were tasked with certain TODO's in our lab assignment, we talked out load about each action our function was taking and it definitely helped me solidify my understanding of my logic/code.

I was happy with this approach in code writing and I will try to continue that process of verbal explanation more in the future.
