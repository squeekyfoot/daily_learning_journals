# Learning Journal - Code 201 - Day 8

Today it felt nice to dip back into HTML for a bit. It's a little easier since it doesn't involve nearly as much logic. However, I'm finding out that time is a great factor for my understanding of JavaScript. Every day that I dabble into the language, the more comfortable I get with it and the better my logic patterns are.

I need to remember to pace myself and keep track of my overall progress. I sometimes get hung up on solving an issue that is not as important as what I am required to do. I am hoping that more practice will strengthen my ability to stay on track during Lab.

The 'Grit' video that was posted in Canvas was actually what I needed, because I feel like if I remember to keep pushing forward during the tough times, I will come out in a great spot later on.
