# Learning Journal - Code 301 - Day 13

Today, was a great day for conceptualizing the course content. Our instructor did a great job of breaking down the idea of using proxies for authenticating on the server side. Heroku was also explained in a clear and detailed way. It was nice to see that we were allowed to use the GUI rather than the command line solely because I'm more of a visual person and it's easier to keep track of the overall deployment/resources in that way.

The lab was fairly straightfoward, we needed to change out a previous AJAX request to an updated GET request since we have included a proxy in our server.js file. The new GET no longer needs the method, headers or Tracey's face since the proxy takes care of those instead.

Afterwards, we had to launch Heroku and access our github and include our repo. Then we created a database from the GUI and finally deployed our app on Heroku. It was an educational process for me because I was able to see what resources an app needs to finally be able to deploy in an environment.

It was nice to be able to complete our lab before we had to leave because I was able to go through the code and see how all the pieces worked together as a whole.
