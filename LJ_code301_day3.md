# Learning Journal - Code 301 - Day 03

Today was pretty decent after I got past the initial shockwave of new language techniques yesterday. I am still struggling a little bit with jQuery selectors and the data attribute selectors for some reason. I will, however, be spending time reading up on these processes to solidify my understanding.

My portfolio page is coming along. I believe the hardest part was figuring out how I needed it set up and what I needed it to do. I have the data and templates set up appropriately, I just need to get the page to be responsive to screen sizes.

During lab time, I was struggling a lot because my partner and I were different in processing things. It took me a lot of patience to get through that section of the day, but In the end, I did come out alive. I worked on our code when I got home and was able to complete it fully. I did keep up communication with my partner via slack as well.

I'm hoping that a good night of rest and a new day will help me re-energize and regain momentum.
