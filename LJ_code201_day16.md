# Learning Journal - Code 201 - Day 16

Today we started planning out our project as a team. We pitched our project to our instruction team on Friday, and we were all green lights.

We started out by creating a flowchart and establishing what data models we were going to use to complete our program. We were able to take pictures of the flowchart/data models and we included them in our team's repository.

We then moved onto creating wireframes for each page we wanted in the project. There will be three separate pages once completed: A welcome page, the main game page and a results page.

After completion of the wireframes, we were able to pitch our completed plan once again to the instruction team to detail our overall scope of the project ahead.

As far as communicating with each other went, it was a little rough at first because we weren't used to working with each other but I quickly learned how everyone's mind seemed to work together.
