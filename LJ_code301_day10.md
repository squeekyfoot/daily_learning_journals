# Learning Journal - Code 301 - Day 10

Today, we learned about functional programming and condensing code to reduce the amount of weak links within our programs. We learned some more ES6 methods in order to pass in functions into other function's arguments to reduce the amount of variables produced and lines of code written.

There were a lot of shorthands used in the lecture that seemed to confuse me a bit when using these new ES6 methods because there were a lot of things that were optional and not required. In a learning environment where you are trying to learn the structure of new languages, it's really hard to retain that information when a method is introduced in multiple ways. I guess as long as I get the overall usage of the methods/process, then I can always use the docs to get detailed information about the things that I couldn't quite catch in the classroom.

For the lab today, there was a lot of work on functional programming. There were a ton of TODO's littered throughout our lab --Tracey's amazing-- but only two hours to complete everything. Since I was still struggling to conceptualize the information given out in class, I was moving pretty slow when it came to cranking out code in the lab. I get to go back and follow the connections in the code and figure out how the instructor pieced the code the way she did.
