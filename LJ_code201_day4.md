# Learning Journal - Code 201 - Day 4

I did pair programming with one of my classmates today and I think it went pretty well. We were able to take turns being the Driver and Navigator on each of our projects. I think this is a wise tool because this gets a second pair of eyes on interpreting your code. This helps avoid conflicts that are overlooked if you happen to not be thinking about them.

We wrote functions into our code so that we can get practice calling out a function in JavaScript. I had a big learning moment when we ran into a merging conflict between the master JS file and the forked one. We were able to research how to remedy the problem on the GitHub website and once we walked through it, I feel I know how to handle them in the future.

Overall, it's been another rewarding day!
