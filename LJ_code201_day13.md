# Learning Journal - Code 201 - Day 13

Today, I had completed implementing my chart into my BusMall page. Afterwards, I noticed that I had a big styling issue that seemed to be cluttered. I spent some time trying to resize different elements and position them so that its a little easier to navigate and test out my page. I also added some buttons to help reset the progress in the browser.

The real fun began at home when I tried to implement the local storage functions. So far, I've gotten persistent data about the question count and progress information, but I still have yet to implement the object storage.

I think I was most likely burnt out at that point, but I was having trouble visualizing how I was supposed to organize my data to be stored into an object in JSON format. It's my first time using that format, so maybe I just need some sleep and maybe figure it out in the morning.

At least for now, I'll submit everything I have and then just keep chugging away at it tomorrow.
