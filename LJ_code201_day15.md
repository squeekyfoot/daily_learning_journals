# Learning Journal - Code 201 - Day 15

Today we shifted gears and focused on our project ideas for next week. It was nice experiencing disagreement between ideas because I feel like in the past. I've always had a bias towards what "I" wanted to do.

The way we discussed the pros and cons of doing certain projects today was nice. It allowed me to be more accepting of others and helped me to change my point of view. It allowed me to even shift my ideas and agree with others.

I think collaborating and doing project pitches was a really useful tool for helping me establish communication with a team. I hope that I will be able to take some of this experience into the work force with me in the future.
